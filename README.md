# FasterBASIC-T 

I like BASIC, it makes programming straightforward for the beginner, 
or for anyone who enjoys being able to program their own computer.

The -T means this version is a transpiler for BASIC, that uses LuaJIT as the code generator.

This is my basic compiler for very standard BASIC, that includes most of the features you would expect if 
you have used BASIC before. 

FasterBASIC deliberately supports most of the features you might expect if you enjoyed BASIC from the 1970s to the 1980s.

It is called FasterBASIC because it is a compiler, the high speed comes from the use of LuaJIT which is magical software.
